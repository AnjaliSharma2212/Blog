# HTTP & REST API – Theoretical Questions

## Q1. What is HTTP and how does it work? Explain the request–response cycle.

### Solution:

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is an application-layer protocol that allows web-based applications to communicate and exchange data. It is used to transfer data between a **client** and a **server** over the web.

HTTP defines:
- How requests are sent  
- How data is returned  
- The format of the data exchanged  

HTTP works on a **request–response model**:
- The client sends a request  
- The server processes it  
- The server sends back a response  

---

### Request–Response Cycle:

### 1. Client sends an HTTP request
When a user types a URL or an application makes an API call, the client sends an HTTP request to the server.

A request contains:
- **HTTP methods** such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.
- **URL / Endpoint**
- **Headers** → metadata (authorization, content-type, etc.)
- **Body** → data sent to the server (optional)

---

### 2. Server receives and processes the request
The server:
- Validates the request  
- Checks authentication and authorization  
- Processes business logic  
- Fetches or modifies data (database, services, etc.)

---

### 3. Server sends an HTTP response
The server sends a response back to the client.

A response contains:
- **Status Code** → `200`, `404`, `500`, etc.
- **Headers** → metadata about the response
- **Body** → requested data or error message

---

### 4. Client handles the response
The client:
- Reads the status code  
- Parses the response body  
- Updates the UI or handles errors  

---

## Q2. What are the different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and when should each be used?

### Solution:

### 1. GET – Fetch Data
**Purpose:** Retrieve data from the server  
**Does NOT change server data**

**When to use:**
- Fetch a list of items
- Fetch a single item
- Read-only operations

**Example:**
 GET /users
 GET /users/5

 
---

### 2. POST – Create New Data
**Purpose:** Send data to the server to create a new resource

**When to use:**
- User registration
- Form submission
- Creating new records

**Example:**
 POST /users


 
---

### 3. PUT – Update Entire Resource
**Purpose:** Replace the entire resource

**When to use:**
- Full update of an entity
- All fields are sent in the request

**Example:**
 PUT /users/5

 
---

### 4. PATCH – Partial Update
**Purpose:** Update only specific fields of a resource

**When to use:**
- Change one or two fields
- Small updates

**Example:**
PATCH /users/5


---

### 5. DELETE – Remove Data
**Purpose:** Delete a resource

**When to use:**
- Remove a user, product, or order

**Example:**
DELETE /users




---

## Q3. Explain HTTP status codes. What’s the difference between 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx?

### Solution:

HTTP status codes are **3-digit numbers** returned by the server to indicate the **result of a client’s request**.

---

### 2xx – Success
The request was successfully processed.
- `200 OK`
- `201 Created`
- `204 No Content`

---

### 3xx – Redirection
The client must take additional action.
- `301 Moved Permanently`
- `302 Found`
- `304 Not Modified`

---

### 4xx – Client Error
The request contains an error from the client side.
- `400 Bad Request`
- `401 Unauthorized`
- `403 Forbidden`
- `404 Not Found`

---

### 5xx – Server Error
The server failed to process a valid request.
- `500 Internal Server Error`
- `502 Bad Gateway`
- `503 Service Unavailable`

---

## Q4. What are HTTP headers? Name some important request and response headers.

### Solution:

HTTP headers are **key–value pairs** that carry **metadata** about the HTTP request or response.

---

### Important Request Headers:
- `Authorization`
- `Content-Type`
- `Accept`
- `User-Agent`
- `Cookie`

---

### Important Response Headers:
- `Content-Type`
- `Set-Cookie`
- `Cache-Control`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
- `Content-Length`

---

## Q5. What is the difference between stateless and stateful protocols? Is HTTP stateless?

### Solution:

### Stateless Protocol:
- Server does not store client information
- Each request is independent

**Example:** HTTP

---

### Stateful Protocol:
- Server stores client state
- Remembers previous interactions

**Examples:**
- FTP
- WebSocket

---

### Is HTTP Stateless?
Yes, **HTTP is stateless by default**.

State can be maintained using:
- Cookies
- Sessions
- Tokens (JWT)

---

## Q6. Explain idempotency in REST APIs. Which HTTP methods are idempotent?

### Solution:

Idempotency means that **making the same request multiple times results in the same final server state**.

---

### Idempotent Methods:
- GET
- PUT
- PATCH (usually)
- DELETE

---

### Non-Idempotent Method:
- POST

---

### Example:
- `DELETE /users/5` called multiple times → user remains deleted  
- `POST /users` called multiple times → multiple users created  



## Q7. What is REST? What are the principles of RESTful API design?

### Solution:

**REST** stands for **Representational State Transfer**.  
It is an **architectural style** used to design scalable and maintainable web APIs.

RESTful APIs allow clients and servers to communicate using **standard HTTP methods** and **URLs to represent resources**.

---

### Principles of RESTful API Design:

### 1. Client–Server Architecture
- Client and server are separated
- Client handles UI
- Server handles data and business logic

---

### 2. Statelessness
- Each request is independent
- Server does not store client state
- All required information is sent with each request

---

### 3. Uniform Interface
- Use standard HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`)
- Use clear and consistent URLs
- Resources are represented using nouns, not verbs

**Example:**
GET /users
POST /orders


### 4. Resource-Based URLs
- Each resource has a unique URL
- URLs represent **resources**, not actions

**Good Example:**
/users/5


---

### 5. Representation of Resources
- Data is transferred in formats like JSON or XML
- JSON is most commonly used

---

### 6. Cacheability
- Responses should define whether they are cacheable
- Improves performance and scalability

---

### 7. Layered System
- Client does not need to know whether it is connected directly to the server
- Supports load balancers, proxies, and gateways

---

## Q8. How would you version a REST API? What are the different approaches?

### Solution:

API versioning is used to **manage changes** without breaking existing clients.

---

### 1. URI Versioning (Most Common)
Version is included in the URL.



✅ Simple and clear  
❌ Changes the URL

---

### 2. Query Parameter Versioning
Version is passed as a query parameter.

**Example:**
/api/users?version=1

✅ Easy to implement  
❌ Not very clean or RESTful

---

### 3. Header Versioning
Version is passed in the request headers.

**Example:**
Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v1+json

✅ Clean URLs  
❌ Harder to test and debug

---

### 4. Content Negotiation Versioning
Version is specified using the `Accept` header.

**Example:**
Accept: application/json;version=1


✅ Very RESTful  
❌ Complex to implement.
